# Handwritten-Digits-Classification
- Building a convolutional neural network model using Pytorch
- Training the model on MNIST dataset, that contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images
- Used ReLU for non-linearity, Maxpool2d, ADAM optimizer, and leraning rate = 1e-3

# Implemented using: 
> PyTorch, Python, Numpy, Matplotlibt, openCv2, and PIL
